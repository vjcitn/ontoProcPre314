Package: ontoProc
Title: processing of ontologies of anatomy, cell lines, and so on
Description: Support harvesting of diverse bioinformatic ontologies,
	making particular use of the ontologyIndex package on CRAN.
	We provide snapshots of key ontologies for terms about
	cells, cell lines, chemical compounds, and anatomy, to help
	analyze genome-scale experiments, particularly cell x compound
        screens.  Another purpose is to strengthen development of
	compelling use cases for richer interfaces to emerging ontologies.
